# neuropix2023
This repository contains MATLAB codes used in XXTX1's dissertation project for NEUR0021.
We give credit to bombcell (https://github.com/Julie-Fabre/bombcell.git), braindraw (https://github.com/Julie-Fabre/braindraw.git), and brainreg (https://github.com/brainglobe/brainreg.git). Some files and lines were taken from these repositories. Dependencies are also found in these repositories.

This repository is purely to serve as reference for the dissertation.
- preprocessing: code files used to process Neuropixels data and histology scans to basal ganglia unit spike activity.
- data_analysis: code files used to produce figures, tables, and data referenced in the dissertation.
- confirmatory: requires get_experiment and get_meanfr first to respectively retrieve unit data and mean firing rates. This is to conduct statistical analysis.
